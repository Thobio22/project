      <h2>Bee loss in the United states of America</h2>
      <p>
        Honey bees — wild and domestic — perform about 80 percent of all pollination worldwide. <br>
        A single bee colony can pollinate 300 million flowers each day. Grains are primarily pollinated <br>
        by the wind, but fruits, nuts and vegetables are pollinated by bees. <br>
        Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can all say that bees are important. Whether for natural vegetation, or our man-made crops, bees play an essential role in the ecosystem<br>
        Because of this, a considerable amount of resources are committed to both collecting data on, and upkeep of bee colonies, <br>
        both used in apiary and in the wild. This data has sparked a lot of controversy on the actual state of the honey bee in the world. <br>
        In the United states of America, researchers are afraid of the apparant decline of the honey bee. They say that each year, <br>
        more bee colonies are lost. Greenpeace points at pesticides, and thus farmers and companies as the main antagonist for this decline.<br>
        Parasites also play a role, and losses in the winter are higher every year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualisations on this site show figures based on data collected over the last 9 years, with a map with bee loss per state, selectable <br>
        per year via a year slider. Under that, a line chart shows the bee loss and crop yield per year, and a pie chart <br>
        which shows probable causation of loss of bee colonies, also selectable per year with the year slider. <br>
        Once clicked on a state in the map, the linechart and piechart show the data corresponding to only that state. <br>
      </p>
      <h3>Concluding message of the collected data</h3>
      <p>
        The line chart accurately shows the bee loss over the years, with only a slight change per year. Percental wise, the <br>
        bee colonies do not increase in loss. It is noteworthy that the crop yield does show correlating changes to the bee loss per state.<br>
        The piechart shows that Varroa mites are the main problem to the honey bee, throughout most of the states, with pesticedes mostly <br>
        on number 2 or 3. </p>
