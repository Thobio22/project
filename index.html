      <h2>Bee loss in the United states of America</h2>
      <p>
        Honey bees — wild and domestic — perform about 80 percent of all pollination worldwide.
        A single bee colony can pollinate 300 million flowers each day. Grains are primarily pollinated
        by the wind, but fruits, nuts and vegetables are pollinated by bees.
        Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can all say that bees are important. Whether for natural vegetation, or our man-made crops, bees play an essential role in the ecosystem
        Because of this, a considerable amount of resources are committed to both collecting data on, and upkeep of bee colonies,
        both used in apiary and in the wild. This data has sparked a lot of controversy on the actual state of the honey bee in the world.
        In the United states of America, researchers are afraid of the apparant decline of the honey bee. They say that each year,
        more bee colonies are lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greenpeace points at pesticides, and thus farmers and companies as the main antagonist for this decline.
        Pesticides interfere with and damage the bees senses, in particular their sense of smell. Because of this, the bees cannot find their
        way back to the hive, either dying of exhaustion or starvation. Parasites also play a role, with the Varroa mite as one of the worst.
        The Varroa mite enters the larvae chambers of larvae that are turning into pupa, before the worker bees close the comb with wax.
        This gives the mite ample time to eat of, and plant her eggs in the pupa. The mites hatch at the same time as the bee leaves
        their pupa and wax comb, thouroughly weakened by the constant leeching of the mites. The hatched mites can then repeat the process,
        while the affected bee is either too weak to fly, or weak enough to not bring in enough pollen. The losses in the winter are reported
        to be higher every year, and many diseases, such as the deformed wing virus, are also on the rise.
        In the Netherlands, the awareness of the problems facing the honey bee is low, with few available data and even less research done.
        If the honey bee is truly in decline as researchers say in America, it is important to increase awareness of this problem,
        if we want our ecosystems and crops to keep thriving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualisations on this site show figures based on data collected over the last 9 years, with a map with bee loss per state, selectable
        per year via a year slider. Under that, a line chart shows the bee loss and yield per year of typical western crops also found in the
        Netherlands that depend on bee pollination. These crops are apples, peaches and pears. On the right is a pie chart which shows probable causation of bee colony loss, also selectable per year
        with the year slider. Once clicked on a state in the map, the linechart and piechart show the data corresponding to only that state.
        The button on the bottom will reset the line and pie chart back to the data for the whole United States.
      </p>
      <h4>Concluding message of the collected data</h4>
      <p>
        The line chart accurately shows the bee loss over the years, with only a slight change per year. Percental wise, the
        bee colonies do not increase in loss. It is noteworthy that the crop yield does show correlating changes to the bee loss per state,
        indicating that the loss in bee colonies greatly affects the yield of crop dependant on bee pollination.
        The piechart shows that Varroa mites are the main problem to the honey bee, throughout most of the states, with pesticedes mostly
        on number 2 or 3. This shows that, while pesticides are a large problem, a solution to the Varroa mite is just as important (for
        the bee).
